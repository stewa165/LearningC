positive integers are stored using:

short int - 2 bytes, 16 bits
int - 4 bytes, 32 bits
unsigned int - 4 bytes, 32 bits
long int - 8 bytes, 64 bits

from right to left:
2^0, 2^1, 2^2, etc.
     1 tells us to add that power; 0 tells us to skip it
     Example:
	5 = 0000101 = 2^0 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5

more bits = more zero's to the left

When the positive value exceeds the number of bits used to store the value, it will produce the highest value capable of being stored with those bits.
If possible, use a different type (long vs. short or int) to store more of the value.
